`pm` is a bash script allowing users to rapidly create new projects. It integrate with tmux to allow for a seamless navigation.

## Prerequisites

- bash 4.0 or higher
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- tmux
- git


## üß∞ Installation

### Using pm

Clone the repository in the recommended location
```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexis-moins/pm.git ~/.pm
```

Go into the install directory and let pm take care of the rest!
```bash
PM_INSTALL_DIR=$(pwd) ./pm link
```

The last command creates a symbolic link to the `pm` script in the `~/.local/bin/` directory (you can also change the link destination path). Finally, if you did not clone the repository in `~/.pm`, run the don't forget to set the `PM_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable globally afterwards!

### Manually

Clone the repository then move the [pm](pm) script to anywhere in your `PATH`, and ensure it is executable!

## üõéÔ∏è Setup

Finally, copy the templates used by pm to create new projects.
```bash
# Create the 'pm' configuration directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/pm

# Copy templates provided by default
copy -r ~/.pm/templates ~/.config/pm/
```

## üå± Quick Start

After installing, you can follow these steps to quickly see how it works:

```bash
# Add a new space (a 'default' space is setup by pm for you)
pm space add personal

# You can then create new projects in this space
pm new portal --space personal

# Opening the project is even simpler
pm open portal --space personal

# You can even clone github repositories directly
pm clone alexis-moins/portfolio --space work
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è  Tmux integration

`pm` suggests the following keybinding to easily open projects from tmux. You can put them at the end of your `~/.tmux.conf`.
```bash
# Leader + o: open a pm project
bind-key o display-popup -E "pm open"
```

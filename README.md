`pm` is a bash script allowing users to rapidly list, create and navigate between your projects. It integrate with different backends (tmux, vscode) for convenience.

## Prerequisites

- bash 4.0 or higher
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
- tmux (optional)
- git


## ðŸ§° Installation

### Using pm

Clone the repository in the recommended location
```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexis-moins/pm.git ~/.pm
```

Go into the install directory and execute the [install](install) script:
```bash
./install
```

The last command creates a symbolic link to the `pm` script in the `~/.local/bin/` directory (you can also change the link destination path by passing it as an argument to the install script).

> If you did not clone the repository in `~/.pm`, don't forget to set the `PM_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable globally afterwards!

### Manually

Clone the repository then move the [pm](pm) script to anywhere in your `PATH`, and ensure it is executable!

## ðŸŒ± Quick Start

After installing, you can follow these steps to quickly see how it works:

```bash
# Add a new space
pm space add personal

# You can then create new projects in this space
pm new <project> -s personal

# pm supports project creation using templates
pm new <project> -s personal -t cargo

# You can list templates...
pm template list

# ...and even create your own
pm template new python-poetry

# Opening a project is even simpler
pm open <project> -s personal

# But using a different backend is also possible
pm open <project> -s personal -b vscode

# You can even clone github repositories directly
pm clone git@github.com:alexis-moins/dot.git -s work
```

## ðŸ¥˜ Misc

### Tmux

You can put the following shortcut at the end of your `~/.tmux.conf` to open a project from tmux interactively.
```bash
# Leader + o: open a pm project
bind-key o display-popup -E "pm open"
```
